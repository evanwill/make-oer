# Open Educational Resources

Open Educational Resources (OER) are *not just a free download*!

{% capture text %}<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Open Educational Resources are teaching, learning and research materials in any medium – digital or otherwise – that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open license that permits no-cost access, use, adaptation and redistribution by others with no or limited restrictions.</p>

OER are materials that are free to access and use--but are also licensed to be modified, adapted, re-mixed, and re-used in new ways. 
<span class="fas fa-lock-open"></span> Open is the key word (see the [Open Definition](https://opendefinition.org/))!
This is the feature that makes OERs so powerful for teaching and learning--they reduce costs for students, but also enable innovation, providing instructors the freedom to flexibly adapt and enrich the learning experience.
