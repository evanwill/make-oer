# Open Educational Resources

Open Educational Resources (OER) are *not just a free download*!

{% capture text %}<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Open Educational Resources are teaching, learning and research materials in any medium – digital or otherwise – that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open license that permits no-cost access, use, adaptation and redistribution by others with no or limited restrictions.</p>

OER are materials that are free to access and use--but are also licensed to be modified, adapted, re-mixed, and re-used in new ways. 
<span class="fas fa-lock-open"></span> Open is the key word (see the [Open Definition](https://opendefinition.org/))!
This is the feature that makes OERs so powerful for teaching and learning--they reduce costs for students, but also enable innovation, providing instructors the freedom to flexibly adapt and enrich the learning experience.

## 5R permissions

When using open licenses such as [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) the author does NOT give up their copyright, but they grant everyone specific **rights** to use the materials.
These are summarized by David Wiley in the [Open Content Definition](http://opencontent.org/definition/) as the "5R permissions":

1. **Retain** – the right to make, own, and control copies of the content (e.g. download, duplicate, store, and manage)
2. **Reuse** – the right to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g. in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a video)
3. **Revise** – the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (e.g. translate the content into another language)
4. **Remix** – the right to combine the original or revised content with other material to create something new (e.g. incorporate the content into a mashup)
5. **Redistribute** – the right to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (e.g. give a copy of the content to a friend)

Licenses can also contain *requirements* (e.g. CC-BY-SA, must share with the same license) or *restrictions* (e.g. CC-BY-NC, no commercial use) that must be followed to granted the permissions.
Remember, OER are more "open" if you choose simple licenses and open, easy to use formats!

# Traditional Examples

Often when we think of OER, we think open textbooks.
These often look just like proprietary textbooks, have the option to be printed, but have the benefits of open licensing.
Some open textbook examples:

- [Introduction to Probability](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/21)  (open textbook at the Open Textbook Library)
- [Project Management for Instructional Designers](https://pm4id.pressbooks.com/) (open textbook created and hosted on PressBooks)
- [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os) (in use in select Statistics courses at UI)
- [OpenStax Psychology](https://openstax.org/details/books/psychology) (in use in select Psychology courses at UI)
