# Why OER?

There is two potential advantages to using OER in the classroom:

1. Textbook Cost <span class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></span>
2. Freedom! <span class="fas fa-rocket"></span> 

## Textbook Cost

Costs of tuition and fees, housing, and healthcare have increased every year for students.

This program was in response to a need on campus-- the issue of textbook cost is one that has a lot of traction, about 3 years ago our students ran a huge petition urging action, and our ASUI  is active in advocating for OER on campus and at the state level.
For many big, lower level courses, this is really low hanging fruit to make a big impact on education affordability.
Faculty often fail to realize that that extra $200 really does make a difference for students, and studies show lowing the cost actually impacts affordability, retention, and positive outcomes in courses.

- equal access to the text, no excuse to not have it
- keep a copy, no need to sell it back or join a rental scheme to save money

## Freedom

- adapt to specific context--responsive to your course, students needs, and pedagogy.
- positive outcomes 

# Why GitHub?

version control
friendly(ish) web platform, lowers barriers to contributors 
editable, sustainable, self-contained, portable

existing open community
transferable skills 

Freed from many of the limitations of a conventionally published text, we were able to add innovative features to enrich the learning experience and flexibly adapt to the needs of the course and students.
Importantly, these interactive features and responsive workflow in creating the textbook compliment the philosophy of inquiry-based learning, a "flipped-classroom" driven by students' exploration and examination of the subject, where the instructor acts as an experienced guide and facilitator.
In this case, GitHub provides an ideal platform not only for project management, collaboration, and sharing source code, but also for implementing an actively evolving textbook informed by an inquiry-based pedagogical method.
Fork / reuse each year - each year is a custom book recording their learning experience
