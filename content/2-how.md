# OER on GitHub

Static Web tools:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} (cloud based platform for version control, collaboration, project management, and code sharing)
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} (free web hosting service)
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} (static site generator, provides the theme / templates)
- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/){:target="_blank"} (simple plain text content)

{% include alert.md text="GitHub is not the only option! There are alternative hosts that offer the similar services, such as [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-com/), or you could manage your own simple static web hosting. This workshop focuses on GitHub because it is the largest community and features the easiest to use web interface." color="success" %}
