# Examples of OER on GitHub

### Software Carpentry

International organization that teaches basic tech skills for researchers. 
Content is collaboratively developed on GitHub by hundreds of contributors.
When running a workshop, organizers create a custom website by forking the SWC templates.

- [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/)
- [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/)

### The Programming Historian

A web journal of peer reviewed tutorials about digital humanities tools, techniques, and research workflows.

- [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/)
- [PH submissions](https://github.com/programminghistorian/ph-submissions) (repository where articles are proposed, developed, and open peer reviewed)

### Music Textbooks

- [Eyes and Ears](http://www.lightandmatter.com/sight/sight.html) by Ben Crowell, 2004 (LaTex / Lilypond [source code](https://github.com/bcrowell/eyes_and_ears))
- [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com/){:target="_blank"}, by Kris Shaffer, Bryn Hughes, and Brian Moseley, 2014+ ([OMT source on GitHub](https://github.com/openmusictheory/openmusictheory.github.io){:target="_blank"})

Sean Butterfield of University of Idaho, with support of the [Think Open Fellowship](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/c.php?g=772392&p=5540605) and Evan Williamson, created an interactive music textbook: 

- [Integrated Musicianship: Theory](https://intmus.github.io/inttheory18-19/){:target="_blank"} 
- [IntMus Theory source code](https://github.com/intmus/inttheory18-19){:target="_blank"} on GitHub
- Interactive features:
    - [abcjs](https://github.com/paulrosen/abcjs){:target="_blank"} (live editable music examples in the text, e.g. [Happy Birthday in G major](https://intmus.github.io/inttheory18-19/02-int-scales-keys/b1-scales.html){:target="_blank"})
    - [Disqus](https://disqus.com/){:target="_blank"} (discussion around assignments, e.g. [Unit 4 assignment](https://intmus.github.io/inttheory18-19/assignments/Fall-semester/2018-09-17.html){:target="_blank"})

### Workshops

[workshop-template](https://github.com/evanwill/workshop-template/) (minimal theme) and [workshop-template-b](https://github.com/evanwill/workshop-template-b/) (Bootstrap theme) are Jekyll templates for a simple workshop website, designed for hosting on GitHub Pages.
As an alternative to making slides or a handout, why not create an open website?
Since it only requires editing a few Markdown files, it is easier to write, access, share, and reuse. 
I have used it for many workshops:

- [get-git](https://uidaholib.github.io/get-git/)
- [go-go gh-pages](https://evanwill.github.io/go-go-ghpages/)
- [hello-arduino](https://evanwill.github.io/hello-arduino/)
- [clean-your-data](https://evanwill.github.io/clean-your-data/)
- [Make @ the MILL](https://uidaholib.github.io/make-at-the-mill/)

### Digital Exhibits

[CollectionBuilder-gh](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh/) is a project to create a simple template for hands-on teaching about digital libraries, taking participants through digitization, metadata creation, to having a live collection site hosted on GitHub.

Similar learning experiences use [Omeka](https://omeka.org/) or other DAMS/[CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) platforms that are overkill for one off projects.
Although CMS feature familiar GUI administration interfaces, they are not simple to learn and customize.
These experiences must focus on teaching the specific tool rather than general web skills and the heavy infrastructure is a barrier to adoption and further development.

`collectionbuilder-gh` aims to be well documented and easy to configure by following the example, with the potential to scaffold to learn a multitude of transferable digital and data skills.
A project in "minimal computing", it provides a depth of learning opportunities, allowing users to take complete ownership over the project and make their work open to the world.
